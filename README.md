#### **THE FIRST**
 + ##### WHY I BUILD THIS PROGRAM
    ###### When I was young.My parents installed the minecraft (bedrock).From now on,I know minecraft was a wonderful software in my mind.It such freedom game is !```YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN IT```.after I found the social videos,I understand minecraft can play with different way.I download the java minecraft.I learned many knowledges,such as redstone technology,auto farms and command_block technology.But made me more curious is mod which chance the game and make the game colorful.I curiously thought how they can do?After,I know it made by JAVA.So I started to learn java and try to make mods now...
